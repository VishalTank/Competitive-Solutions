# Competitive-Solutions

This repository consists of my attempt to various coding problems from different platforms like hacekrrank , hackerearth , spoj etc.

# A reminder to all visitors

-I advise not to directly copy and paste the code to any problem , but to try to analyze the problem and figure out the approach to it.

-Feel free to edit the codes that are not accepting or giving any kind of errors.

-These are just my solutions to different problems , there maybe a better solution available to a problem. so please do edit if you find better solution than my solution.

Happy Coding!
